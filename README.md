# GeoSentinel - Safety Performance System

A comprehensive worker engagement and safety compliance performance platform designed for mining and industrial safety operations.

## 🎯 Overview

The Safety Performance System transforms traditional safety protocols into engaging, interactive experiences that motivate workers to maintain high safety standards through:

- **Points & Rewards**: Earn points for safety compliance and quick response times
- **Achievement Badges**: Unlock badges for consistent safety performance
- **Leaderboards**: Compete with colleagues in friendly safety challenges
- **Daily Challenges**: Complete safety tasks and training objectives
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor individual and team safety improvements

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Performance Component** (`src/components/Performance.tsx`): Main UI interface with tabbed navigation
- **Performance Service** (`src/services/performanceService.ts`): Business logic and data management
- **Performance Hook** (`src/hooks/usePerformance.ts`): React state management and API interactions

### Data Models

- **Worker**: Individual worker profile with points, level, badges, and safety metrics
- **Challenge**: Safety tasks with progress tracking and point rewards
- **Badge**: Achievement rewards with rarity levels and requirements
- **Leaderboard**: Competitive rankings based on safety performance
